  abstract = {We recently started a project funded by the Horizon Europe program, BioPIM, which aims to accelerate various bioinformatics algorithms using processing-in-memory (PIM) technologies. PIM is a type of computer architecture that aims to solve the issue of data movement between the CPU and memory being a bottleneck in data-intensive applications. PIM accomplishes this by integrating computing units directly into the memory chip, which reduces latency and increases bandwidth by bringing the computing units closer to the memory. Since read mapping is a crucial step in almost all genome analysis studies, we first aimed to understand how to accelerate read mapping in this project.
As the first step, we analyzed the computational workload of BWA-MEM and Bowtie2 for short reads, NGMLR, Minimap2 and LRA for long reads, and finally minigraph, vg, GraphAligner and GWFA for read-to-graph aligners. Here we present a first-pass workload analysis using the Intel vtune tool to identify the most time and memory-bandwidth consuming functions used by these algorithms. Our preliminary results show that the resource usage of these algorithms varied significantly depending on the type of data and the algorithm used. We have identified several potential functions that could potentially be improved by PIM. Furthermore, we discuss processing-in-memory architectures to accelerate alignment and search algorithms for resequencing experiments.
Overall, our study provides insights into the resource requirements of different alignment and search algorithms for different types of sequencing data, which can guide the selection of the most appropriate algorithms for different resequencing experiments. Our findings can also inform the development of more efficient and accurate algorithms for processing sequencing data, which is critical for advancing our understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases.},
