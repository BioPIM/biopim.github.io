  abstract = {The reference genome is the representative genome of a species. Most genomics analyses begin with or involve a comparison with the reference genome of the same species, which serves as a template for the newly sequenced sample of an individual. However, using a single reference genome creates reference bias since it does not contain information about all individuals of a species to represent the genomic diversity. The rapid development of sequencing technologies has led to an increasing number of samples being studied. With the growing number of genetic materials sampled, genomics pursues utilizing this data to express all samples and capture vast genetic diversity. So, to alleviate these problems and enable diverse variance studies (e.g., bacterial pathogenicity, antibacterial resistance, virulence, human leukocyte antigens), pangenome structures are proposed. As the efforts to collect more data to improve the diversity representation on the pangenome are growing, the computational methods to assist this field become more vital to meet the high demand. Therefore, there is a pressing need for acceleration methods tuned for mapping sequences to pangenomes. To address this problem, in this work, we propose a hardware/software co-design framework for optimizing the pangenome graphs for compact storage and developing efficient algorithms that eventually lead to fast and accurate sequence-to-pangenome mapping. Our framework combines several steps (e.g., indexing, seeding, and alignment), and the accelerator includes optimized designs based on each step's requirements.},

  abstract = {We recently started a project funded by the Horizon Europe program, BioPIM, which aims to accelerate various bioinformatics algorithms using processing-in-memory (PIM) technologies. PIM is a type of computer architecture that aims to solve the issue of data movement between the CPU and memory being a bottleneck in data-intensive applications. PIM accomplishes this by integrating computing units directly into the memory chip, which reduces latency and increases bandwidth by bringing the computing units closer to the memory. Since read mapping is a crucial step in almost all genome analysis studies, we first aimed to understand how to accelerate read mapping in this project.
As the first step, we analyzed the computational workload of BWA-MEM and Bowtie2 for short reads, NGMLR, Minimap2 and LRA for long reads, and finally minigraph, vg, GraphAligner and GWFA for read-to-graph aligners. Here we present a first-pass workload analysis using the Intel vtune tool to identify the most time and memory-bandwidth consuming functions used by these algorithms. Our preliminary results show that the resource usage of these algorithms varied significantly depending on the type of data and the algorithm used. We have identified several potential functions that could potentially be improved by PIM. Furthermore, we discuss processing-in-memory architectures to accelerate alignment and search algorithms for resequencing experiments.
Overall, our study provides insights into the resource requirements of different alignment and search algorithms for different types of sequencing data, which can guide the selection of the most appropriate algorithms for different resequencing experiments. Our findings can also inform the development of more efficient and accurate algorithms for processing sequencing data, which is critical for advancing our understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases.},
