# External Expert Advisory Board

The following board of experts provide a valuable outside opinion on the progress and objectives of the BioPIM project.

## [Jared Simpson](https://oicr.on.ca/researchers/jared-simpson/)

Ontario Institute for Cancer Research

The Simpson lab develops algorithms and software for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. The lab, led by Dr. Jared Simpson, works primarily on de novo genome assembly, the detection of somatic mutations in cancer and, most recently, the development of algorithms for nanopore-based sequencers.

University of Maryland

Uzi Vishkin's research aspirations evolved over the years from that of a parallel algorithms theory specialist to more of a generalist. The deep question guiding his work has been whether it is feasible to align the theory of parallel algorithms, parallel programming and many-core hardware into a coherent computing stack for the processor of the future. Along with his research team, he developed the only current approach that enables that, while vendor-supported approaches have given up on their prior objective.
