**BioPIM** consists of five academic institutions and two companies from four European countries, Turkey, Switzerland, France, and Israel. The partners have complementary expertise within the disciplines of computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering and genomics allowing an interdisciplinary approach for achieving **BioPIM**'s goals. 

Engagement of partners from different but complementary backgrounds will brighten up breakthrough features of **BioPIM** and ensure attainment of the strategic objectives of the consortium. **Objective 1**, which includes optimizing algorithms and data structures for PIM will take guidance from **Bilkent**, **Pasteur**, and **CNRS**. We will use several software tools to profile computational behavior, some of which were developed by **ETH Zurich** and **IBM Research Zürich**. **Objective 2**, which involves hardware/software co-development requires expertise by all participants, where algorithmic aspects will be guided by **Bilkent**, **Pasteur**, and **CNRS**, and hardware development will be guided by **ETH Zurich**, **TECHNION**, **Bar-Ilan**, **IBM**, and **UPMEM**. **Objective 3**, which involves PIM architecture prototyping and API design requires expertise in simulation infrastructures that **ETH Zurich**, **IBM**, and **UPMEM** have, and API development that **Pasteur** will lead with the participation of **Bilkent**, **ETH Zurich**, **IBM**, **Bar-Ilan**, and **TECHNION**.
